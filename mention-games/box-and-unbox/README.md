# Adding it through YAGPDB.xyz
1. Create the desired role in the Discord server. Ensure that Developer mode is enabled to retrieve the Role IDs for the code.
2. On the left panel, navigate to "Custom Commands".
3. For each file in the repository, create a new custom command.
4. Replace the Role IDs by your newly created roles in the server accordingly.

To keep commands organised and only have it work in specific channels, it is **strongly recommended to create a command group** and create the custom commands within.
